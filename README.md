## When to book a session?
 - First session
   - When you want to discuss the idea
   - When you have the wireframes ready
   - When you want to discuss about how are you going to code the project

 - Second session
   - When the project is 30% or 50% done
   - When you coded something
   - When there is code I can review

 - Third session
   - When project is done 90% or more
   - When you fixed all the problems we spotted on the 2nd session
   - When you are just about to submit the project, but you want me to check it one more time before you do
